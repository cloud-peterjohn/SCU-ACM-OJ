## Introduction
SCU-ACM-OJ is an Online Judge system specifically designed for school-level ACM programming competitions, aimed at addressing the issues of existing OJ systems being unsuitable for school-level competitions. The system significantly enhances competition organization efficiency and participants' experience through a simple user interface, efficient competition organization, and comprehensive evaluation and feedback.
## Contributions

It provides administrators with automated file parsing to facilitate bulk competition registration and problem package uploads. Additionally, it features a code security detection mechanism based on LLM, offering comprehensive functional support, efficient competition management, and a secure and reliable platform for school-level ACM competitions.
